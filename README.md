#Creating a Safer Delhi for Women - Strengthening Law and Order for Inclusive Urban Safety
Safe cities are pivotal for achieving Viksit Bharat@2047 by unlocking the 'gender dividend.' Law enforcement is central to ensuring women's safety, but its success depends on adopting modern technologies, implementing strong policies, and fostering collaboration among all stakeholders. Despite the tools like CCTV cameras and safety apps, delays in response and underutilization highlight significant gaps. Fixing these shortcomings, improving safety protocols, and holding responsible parties accountable are essential steps to make Delhi safer for everyone.

Team Name: Shield Tap
Background
We are students of IGDTUW. While commuting to central Delhi regions, we often encounter multiple safety concerns. The scattered nature of available information across various platforms adds to the confusion, making it harder to respond effectively in unsafe situations.
To address these challenges, we introduce "Shield Tap," a one-stop safety app that empowers users with reliable, centralized safety resources. With Shield Tap, you can feel more confident and prepared to navigate uncertain situations.

Key Features of Shield Tap
1. O2 Customizable SOS Button
Single Tap SOS: Immediate action with the press of a button.
Hold for 3 Seconds: Automatically informs nearby police stations, family, friends, NGOs, and other app users within proximity. Your location is shared, a call to the police helpline is initiated, and audio is recorded and transmitted in real time.
Triple Tap Notification: Alerts selected individuals when you feel insecure and allows you to share notifications instantly.
2. Safety Indicators
O2 acts as a safety indicator:
Green, Yellow, Red Levels: These indicate safety conditions in specific areas as you travel.
Safety Prediction Using AI: The app analyzes multiple factors like street illumination, number of CCTV cameras, proximity to police stations, pink booths, and recent criminal activities to assess safety levels.

Why This Matters:
Imagine visiting an unfamiliar area. For instance, Aanya and her friends once visited Chandni Chowk for food but unknowingly entered a red-light district. This unforeseen situation posed a major safety threat, highlighting the importance of such a feature.
Community-Driven ApproachTo ensure accurate and up-to-date information, Shield Tap leverages a community-driven model:
Verified User Base: Only Aadhaar-verified users can register, preventing misuse and misinformation.
Collaborative Efforts:
Police: Update station contact numbers and respond efficiently.
NGOs: Provide timely assistance to those in need.
Citizens: Share experiences, report issues like streetlight failures, and contribute to improving the community.
Additional Features:
CCTV Mapping: Residents can mark their CCTV camera locations. The AI anomaly detection model analyzes these cameras to identify potential threats like burglary or illegal activities.
Incident Reporting: Police investigation officers can access nearby CCTV reports for faster resolutions.
Self-Help Module
The app offers a comprehensive self-help module with three components:
1. Self-Defense Tutorials:
Learn basic defense techniques such as:
Knee strikes
Hammerfist attacks
2. Legal Resources:Stay informed about
Laws: Covering Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, dowry prohibition, and POCSO Act.
